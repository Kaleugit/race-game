# DevOps Skill

This skill standardizes delivery and operations changes with release safety and operational clarity.

## When To Use
- When designing or updating CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure, or operational reliability.

## Additional Inputs To Read
Assume baseline context from `AGENTS.md` is already loaded.

1. `memory-system/workstreams/devops/notes.md` (mandatory if exists)
2. `docs/PROJECT_SPECS.md`
3. `docs/architecture.md`
4. `docs/tech-stack.md`
5. `memory-system/task-docs/TASK-<github-login>-<task-key>-[role|workstream]-planning-[YYYY-MM-DD].md` (if exists)

## Workflow
1. Define target environment, constraints, and rollout expectations.
2. Plan build/deploy pipeline changes with rollback path.
3. Apply infra/runtime changes incrementally.
4. Validate deployability, health checks, and failure behavior.
5. Validate observability baseline (logs/metrics/alerts).
6. Record evidence, operational notes, and residual risks.

## Mandatory Rules
- Application source code must stay in `src/` (or `*/src/` in monorepo).
- Prefer simple deploy pipelines before advanced orchestration.
- No release without rollback strategy when risk is medium/high.
- If SLO/release criteria are unclear, ask the human before finalizing.
- Resolve ambiguities using `AGENTS.md` Decision Resolution Precedence and `PROJECT_SPECS.md` Section 10 criteria before escalating to human. Escalate only for Mandatory Escalation Conditions (`AGENTS.md`).

## Required Outputs
- Pipeline/deployment changes documented.
- Rollout and rollback steps explicit.
- Acceptance criteria status with evidence (`PASS`/`FAIL`).
- Updated task planning/report artifacts when task-driven.

## Quality Bar
- Build, test, and deploy flow is deterministic.
- Runtime has minimum observability and health signals.
- Operational risk and runbook steps are explicit.
